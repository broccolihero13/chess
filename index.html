    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <p>Chess is played on a square board divided into eight rows of squares called ranks and eight columns called files,
        with a dark square in each player's lower left corner. This is altogether 64 squares. The colors of the squares
        are laid out in a checker (chequer) pattern in light and dark squares. To make speaking and writing about chess
        easy, each square has a name. Each rank has a number from 1 to 8, and each file a letter from A to H. This means
        that every square on the board has its own label, such as g1 or f5. The pieces are in white and black sets. The
        players are called White and Black, and at the start of a game each player has 16 pieces. The 16 pieces are one
        king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights and eight pawns.</p>
    <h2>Movement</h2>
    <p>Definitions: vertical lines are files; horizontal lines are ranks; lines at 45° are diagonals. Each piece has its
        own way of moving around the board.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The knight is the only piece that can jump over another piece.</li>
        <li>No piece may move to a square occupied by a piece of the same color.</li>
        <li>All pieces capture the same way they move, except pawns.</li>
        <li>The king's move is one square in any direction. The king (K for short) may not move to any square where it
            is threatened by an opposing piece. However, the king can move to a square that is occupied by an opponent's
            piece and capture the piece, taking it off the board.
        <li>
        <li>The queen (Q) can move any distance in any direction on the ranks, files and diagonals.
        <li>
        <li>The rooks (R) move any distance on the ranks or files.
        <li>
        <li>The bishops (B) move diagonally on the board. Since a bishop can only move diagonally, it will always be on
            the same color square.
        <li>
        <li>The knights (Kt or N) move in an "L" shape. Each move must be either two squares along a rank and one square
            along a file, or two squares along a file and one square along a rank. It is the only piece that can jump
            over other pieces. Like the other pieces, it captures an opposing piece by landing on its square.
        <li>
        <li>The pawns can only move up the board. On its first move a pawn may move either one or two squares forward. A
            pawn captures one square diagonally, not as it moves: see white circles on its diagram. Besides, in some
            situations pawns can capture opponent's pawns in a special way called en passant, which means in passing in
            French (see below).
        <li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Capturing</h2>
    <p>Most pieces capture as they move. If a piece lands on an opponent's piece, the opposing piece is taken off the
        board. There are three special cases:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The king cannot be taken (see check and checkmate).</li>
        <li>No piece can be taken while castling (see below).</li>
        <li>Pawns take one square diagonally.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Check and Mate</h2>
    <p>If a move is made which attacks the opposing king, that king is said to be 'in check'. The player whose king is
        checked must make a move to remove the check. The options are: moving the king, capturing the threatening piece,
        or moving another piece between the threatening piece and the king. If the player whose king is in danger cannot
        do any of these things, it is checkmate, and the player loses the game.</p>
    <h2>Special Moves</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Castling</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once in every game, each king can make a special move, known as castling. When the King castles, it
                moves two squares to the left or right. When this happens, the Rook is moved to stand on the opposite
                side of the King. Castling is only allowed all if all of these rules are kept
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Neither piece doing the castling may have been moved during the game.</li>
                <li>There must be no pieces between the king and the rook.</li>
                <li>The king may not be currently in check, nor may the king pass through any square attacked by the
                    opponent. As with any move, castling is not allowed if it would place the king in check.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>En Passant</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>En Passant is a special capture. t is only available when a pawn moves forward two squares past an
                opposing pawn on an adjacent file. The opposing pawn must be on the 5th rank from its own side. Then the
                opponent's pawn can capture the double-mover as if it had only moved one square forward. This option is
                open on the next move only.
            <li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Promotion</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>hen a pawn moves to its eighth rank, it must be changed for a piece: a queen, rook, bishop, or knight of
                the same color (player's choice).[17] Normally, the pawn is queened, but in some advantageous cases
                another piece is chosen, called 'under-promotion'.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
    <h2>Ways a Game May End</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wins</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Checkmate. When a king is in check, and cannot get out of it.</li>
            <li>Resignation. A player may resign at any time, usually because his/her position is hopeless. A losing
                player is able to resign by placing their king on its side on the chessboard.
            </li>
            <li>Out of time. If player's clock time is over (exceeding the time control). Strictly speaking, this is not
                part of the rules of the game, but part of the rules of tournament and match chess where chess clocks
                are used.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Draws</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Draw agreed. A game may end in a draw at any time if one player offers a draw and the other accepts.
            </li>
            <li>Dead position. A position where no series of legal moves could lead to a mate (example: K+B vs K). The
                game is drawn.
            </li>
            <li>Stalemate. If a player cannot make a move, and the player's king is not in check, this is also a draw.
                This kind of draw is called a stalemate, and is rare.
            </li>
            <li>50-move rule. A game will also end in a draw if no piece is captured and no pawn has moved after fifty
                moves. This is called the fifty-move rule, and happens late in the game.
            </li>
            <li>Threefold repetition. If the exactly same position is repeated three times during a game with the same
                player to move each time, the player next to move may claim a draw. The game is now drawn. This is
                called a draw by threefold repetition.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
